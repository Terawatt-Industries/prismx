The PrismX 3D Printer - fast, reliable, precise, and affordable.

This repository contains all the software used with the PrismX 3D Printer; slicing software; a link to the Arduino IDE for firmware updates; as well as the hardware source code files for reference and sharing.

NOTE:  This is a top-level directory that contains "git submodules".  This means it's a little tougher to download everything at once - which is good because there are _many_ files.  Attempting to download the repository as a ZIP or TARball will not download the files you expected.

Please see [this Github repository](https://github.com/Terawatt-Industries/prismx) for more information about how to download all of the files in this repository.
